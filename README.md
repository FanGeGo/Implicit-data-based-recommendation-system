### Introduction
According to a new report released by Nielsen Music, on average, Americans now spend just slightly more than 32 hours a week listening to music. This is a staggering 36% increase in 2 years and has been made possible due to the popularity of music streaming sites like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music etc. 
With such a tremendous growth in the music industry, it becomes crucial to deliver personalized music recommendation to the listeners. This piqued our curiosity to understand the process that goes behind the music recommendation engine and led us to work on this project.  
lastfm is one of the oldest music streaming companies that started providing personalized recommendations to its listeners. Although this dataset is 10 years old, the algorithms and the methologies applied would still be relevant for the latest songs and albums.
	
### Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.6.5  
**Packages**  
* Implicit  
**Datasource**
* lastfm open source dataset

### Algorithms
* Collaborative filtering
* Alternating least squares
* Matrix factorization

### Approach:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Creation of sparse matrix
3. Building the recommendation system
4. Evaluating the recommendation system
5. Recommendation examples


## Online retail recommendation system  
## Introduction  
This is my first project on recommendation system performed on Online retail dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
The entire approach is similar to that of the music recommendation above.
